# Data Structures Implementation Repository

This repository contains a collection of C++ scripts, each implementing different data structures and related concepts. The scripts are designed to provide clear examples of how various data structures can be implemented and used in C++ programming. This repository is ideal for students, educators, or anyone interested in learning more about data structures in C++.

## Files and Descriptions:

1. **Pila Floats.cpp**
   - **Description**: Implements a stack data structure specifically for floating-point numbers. Demonstrates basic stack operations like push, pop, and peek.

2. **Pilas Char.cpp**
   - **Description**: A stack implementation for character data. This script showcases how stacks can be used to store and manage character-type data.

3. **Pilas Con Array Dinamico.cpp**
   - **Description**: Features a stack implementation using dynamic arrays. This script highlights dynamic memory management in stack operations.

4. **Pilas Enlazadas.cpp**
   - **Description**: Implements stacks using linked lists. This script provides insight into how linked lists can be utilized to create flexible and efficient stack structures.

5. **abb.cpp**
   - **Description**: Stands for 'Arbol Binario de Búsqueda' (Binary Search Tree). This script implements a binary search tree, demonstrating insertion, deletion, and search operations.

6. **ejemplo_bool_to_file.cpp**
   - **Description**: A utility script that demonstrates how to write boolean values to a file in C++. Useful for understanding file I/O operations in C++.

7. **monticulos.cpp**
   - **Description**: Implements a heap data structure, also known as a 'montículo'. This script covers the creation of heaps and operations like heapify, insert, and delete.

8. **pilas_constr_destruct.cpp**
   - **Description**: Focuses on the construction and destruction of stacks. This script is particularly useful for understanding the lifecycle of a stack, including constructor and destructor functionalities.

9. **secuencias.cpp**
   - **Description**: Implements sequence data structures. This script is useful for understanding how sequences can be managed and manipulated in C++.

## Repository Overview:

The scripts in this repository are designed to provide practical examples of various data structures in C++. From basic stacks and heaps to more complex structures like binary search trees and sequences, these scripts cover a wide range of data structure implementations. Each script is self-contained and provides a clear demonstration of the respective data structure, making this repository a valuable resource for anyone looking to enhance their understanding of data structures in C++.
